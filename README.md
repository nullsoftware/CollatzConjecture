# Collatz Conjecture
The **Collatz conjecture** is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer ***n***. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of ***n***, the sequence will always reach 1.

It is also known as the **3*n* + 1 problem**, the **3*n* + 1 conjecture**.
